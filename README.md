# MMA FIGHT PREDICTOR
A predictor for MMA fights!

**Refer to workflow.ipynb for a detailed breakdown on my workflow for this project**

Mixed Martial Arts is a very unpredictable sport. There exists a large number of variables from stemming from the multitude of styles and attacks allowed in the sport. So I've created this mma-predictor to try and make sense of all the chaos and hopefully glimpse into the future!

The data was gathered from [UFC Stats](https://www.ufcstats.com) using Beautiful Soup and cleaned with NumPy and pandas. Scikit-learn was used to fit a logistic regression model to the data and predict the outcome of a fight. 

Initial testing with logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and random forest classifier classifier models yielded prediction rates of 89.93%, 73.83%%, and 85.91% respectively.

# Running the Predictor

To use the predictor, clone the repository and execute the "run-predictor.sh" script. Currently the tool only predicts the next upcoming UFC event. However, I plan to add functionality that will allow for the user to input any two fighters.
