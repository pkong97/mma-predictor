    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Background\n",
    "Mixed Martial Arts is a unique sport. There exists a large number of variables from stemming from the multitude of styles and attacks allowed in the sport which can make the fights quite unpredictable. Therefore, I sought to create a predictor that could make sense of the sport's chaos and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What variables are the most important in determining the winner? (ie. striking? takedowns?)\n",
    "* Is there a metric that can be used to determine who is the better fighter?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Objectives\n",
    "The objective of this project is to create a model that:\n",
    "* Predicts better than 50% accuracy\n",
    "* Create a ranking system for fighters"

    "### **Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Collection\n",
    "The data was gathered from [UFC Stats](https://www.ufcstats.com/) using webscrapers built with Python's Beautiful Soup library. Two separate types of data were collected: fighter data and fight data. Both types of data were stored in separate Pandas data frames. The webscraper scripts can be found at the [webscraper section](https://github.com/pkong97/mma-predictor/tree/master/webscrapers) of my github repository. \n",

    "Description of columns:\n",
    "* id - fighter id\n",
    "* name - fighter's name\n",
    "* height - fighter's height (ft, in)\n",
    "* weight - fighter's weight (lbs)\n",
    "* reach - fighter's reach (in)\n",
    "* dob - fighter's date of birth\n",
    "* ss_min - significant strikes per minute\n",
    "* str_acc - striking accuracy\n",
    "* str_a_min - significant strikes absorbed per minute\n",
