    "Mixed Martial Arts is a unique sport. There exists a large number of variables from stemming from the multitude of styles and attacks allowed in the sport which can make the fights quite unpredictable. Therefore, I sought to create a predictor that could make sense of the sport's chaos and answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What variables are the most important in determining the winner? (ie. striking? takedowns?)\n",
    "* Is there a metric that can be used to determine who is the better fighter?\n",

    "The objective of this project is to create a model that:\n",
    "* Predicts better than 50% accuracy\n",
    "* Create a ranking system for fighters"
